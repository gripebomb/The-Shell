This theme was forked to fit my needs for my website's appearence.

It was originally created by [Dmitry Lebedev](https://github.com/mityalebedev) as a minimalistic dark color theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). As in the original creator's `README`, you can [support him](https://how-to-help-ukraine-now.super.site/) as he is from Ukraine.
